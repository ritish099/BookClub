# MERN template project

# Introduction
We are building the client and server as completely separate applications so that we can work on them separately.

# Setup

## Server
- go to nodejs website and install the LTS version
- clone the repo
- open repo locally from terminal and go to client
```bash
  cd ./client
```
- run the following commands
```js
  //install packages
  npm install

  //run
  npm run start

  //if you see the following message on browser, everything is working fine
  Hello, React is working fine!
```

## Client

- go to server folder now

- run the commands
```js

//install packages
npm install

//run
npm run start

//if you see the following message on terminal, everything is working fine
Server API running on port 8080!
```
